PROBLEM STATEMENT 

You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and
a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.
Complete the Student class by writing the following:
â€¢ A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
1. A string. first Name.
2. A string, last Name.
3. An integer, idNumber.
4. An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average

SOLUTION

class Person:
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)

class Student(Person):
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber, scores):
        super().__init__(firstName, lastName, idNumber)
        self.scores = scores

    # Function to calculate grade
    def calculate(self):
        avg = sum(self.scores) / len(self.scores)
        if avg >= 90:
            return 'O'  # Outstanding
        elif avg >= 80:
            return 'E'  # Excellent
        elif avg >= 70:
            return 'A'  # Average
        elif avg >= 55:
            return 'P'  # Pass
        elif avg >= 40:
            return 'D'  # Poor
        else:
            return 'T'  # Troll


line = input().split()
firstName = line[0]
lastName = line[1]
idNum = line[2]
numScores = int(input()) # not needed for Python
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) )
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)
s.printPerson()
print("Grade:", s.calculate())
