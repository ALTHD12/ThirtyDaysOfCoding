PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the
following 3 lines:
1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where num Swaps is the number of swaps that took place.
2. First Element: firstElement
where first Element is the first element in the sorted array.
3. Last Element: lastElement
where last Element is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

SOLUTION

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())

    a = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    numSwaps = 0  

    # Bubble Sort Algorithm
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - 1):  
            if a[j] > a[j + 1]:
                a[j], a[j + 1] = a[j + 1], a[j]
                numSwaps += 1

        if numSwaps == 0:
            break

    print(f"Array is sorted in {numSwaps} swaps.")
    print(f"First Element: {a[0]}")
    print(f"Last Element: {a[-1]}")
