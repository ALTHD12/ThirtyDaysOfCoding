PROBLEM STATEMENT

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
• A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the_elements instance variable.
• A compute Difference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in _elements and stores it in the maximum Difference instance variable.

SOLUTION

class Difference:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.__elements = a
        self.maximumDifference = 0
	# Add your code here
    def computeDifference(self):
        # Calculate the maximum absolute difference
        self.maximumDifference = max(self.__elements) - min(self.__elements)

# End of Difference class

_ = input()
a = [int(e) for e in input().split(' ')]

d = Difference(a)
d.computeDifference()

print(d.maximumDifference)
